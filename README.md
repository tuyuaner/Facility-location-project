# Facility-location-project (Google earth mapping project)

This is a project for solving facility location problems. 

The facility location problem, also known as location analysis or k-center problem, is a branch of operations research and computational geometry concerned with the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing, and competitors' facilities. --wiki

This project successfully solves facility location project using the greedy method.


Input - Given a geographic data
        Enter the radius of coverage
      
Return -a kml file, based on the radius of coverage user enters.

Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within Internet-based, two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers. KML was developed for use with Google Earth.


Below demonstrates how it would look like when running in Google Earth.
